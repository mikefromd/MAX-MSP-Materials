# MAX/MSP

MSP is a set of objects within MAX 8 that allows you to create and manipulate audio/sound directly. While MAX was using a MIDI Syntheziser to make music, MSP allows us
to fully control the process of making audio.

In this repository you find some basic materials, the folder `Patches` contains patches and audio files to work with and remix in MAX 8.

## To get started

I suggest that you just assemble by yourself a small starter patch with the objecta and arguments

- `cycle~ 440`
- `gain~`
- `ezdac~`

and try to get a sound out of it. You may also add a numberbox and connect its outlet with the inlet of the cycle~ object.

Next, load the patch below, it allows you to learn more about  audio and sound within MAX.

Please have a look at the website [Learning Synths](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/en/get-started), it is an easy way to learn and try out the basics of
synthezising sound. Afterwards, you can try to reproduce the effects introduced there directly with MAX/MSP.
