# MAX/MSP

MSP is a set of objects within MAX 8 that allows you to create and manipulate audio/sound directly. While MAX was using a MIDI Syntheziser to make music, MSP allows us
to fully control the process of making audio.

In this repository you find some basic materials, the folder `Patches` contains patches and audio files to work with and remix in MAX 8.

Please have a look at the website [Learning Synths](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/en/get-started), it is an easy way to learn and try out the basics of
synthezising sound. Afterwards, you can try to reproduce the effects introduced there directly with MAX/MSP.
